				   ==============================


There are two ways, do everything all at once, or each step at a time.


ALL AT ONCE:
Run "newdisks" batch file on a two drive system.


ONE STEP AT A TIME:
Format two disks.

Run "mv 0" "mv 1" and "mv 2".  These programs read the files "drv0", "drv1",
"drv2" to find out what goes onto each disk, then create the files
"vol0", "vol1", and "vol2", which hold the actual game disks contents.

Run "xfer" for disk 1 only.  This moves down the bootstrap sectors,
"kq.exe", and "load" (which loads "kq.exe" when game is booted.

Run "wrtit" for disk 1 only.  This moves down "words.tok," and "*.ovl".

Run "wrtvol0" and "wrtvol1" batch files to move "vol0" and "vol1"
down to make disk 1.

Run "wrtvol0" and "wrtvol2" batch files to move "vol0" and "vol2"
down to make disk 2.

Run "wrtdirs" to move the directories to disk 1 only.
